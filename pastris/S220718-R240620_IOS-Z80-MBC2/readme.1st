This is the custom firmware that simply brings the timer from the arduino forward thrugh a custom Op code.
it's Very dirty. it uses a string broken up into ascii characters to make it simple for use in something
like turbo pascal.  There's probably a much better way of doing this, but it works for my game so... 

I know there is a 'real systick' firmware out there for fusix. at some point i'd really like to look into
moding my source to make it work. for now this works.

If you'd like look at the comments in the sketch to see how it works.
