{RTC Liberary (C) 2020 D. Collins This allows simple use of the RTC in turbo
 pascal. This can be included at compile time.  There are 2 global variables
 due to TP3 not letting you use array type for functions, this does allow the
 timestamps to be stored as array's and used more simply; as you can not use
 the standard port comand as such.  to update the global CurrentTime, simply
 call the RTCGetTime. As is use at own risk, free to use and distribute.

 The updated version of the library has a function for calling the hacked
 quick and dirty MS timer I modded to the arduino sketch for the Z80MBC2
 the timer chip outputs a maximum 11 character string wich is the long number
 output of the millis() function from the arduio. }
